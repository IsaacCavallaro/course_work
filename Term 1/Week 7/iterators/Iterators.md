# Iterators

- Both **hahes** and **arrays** in ruby are known as *Collections*.

- Collections have predefined methods which allow us to iterate over them. 

- These methods are known as **iterators**.

# Iterator Syntax

1. Iterator syntax example with keywords **do** and **end**.

        collection.each do |item|
            code to be executed per iteration
        end

2. **Shorthand** with curly braces replacing keywords **do** and **end**.


        collection.each { |variable| code }

- It's best to use the first examples syntax for a **multi-line block of code**.

- Shorthand works well for **single line code**.

# Three parts to any iterator
 
 ### Example block of iteration:

          collection.each do |item|
            code to be executed per iteration
          end

1. **METHOD** 

-  **each** is the method in the example above. This will iterate over every element in the **collection**.

        .each 
           

2. **VARIABLE**

- **item** is the variable in the example above and is represented by being place between two | | (referred to as **PIPES**).

        |item|


3. **CODE/BLOCK**

- This is a **block of code** that is executed with every iteration. 

        code to be executed per iteration



# Block

- A **Block** is a piece of code that is executed between the keywords **do** and **end** OR between {} referred to as *curley braces*.

- Blocks of code get executed for each iteration of the collection. 

- In other words, the code that is being executed for every iteration is called a **Block**.


# Methods

- The **each** method iterates through every element in the *collection* (Hash or Array) and then executes the code block.

- Each iterator for an **array** takes  **ONE** argument.
    - item

- Each iterator for a **hash** takes **TWO** arguments.

    - key and value

# Each method with Array

## Example 1 - Array with each method

        numbers = ["one","two","three","four"]
        
        numbers.each do |item| 
            p item
        end

        => "one"
        => "two"
        => "three"
        => "four"


## Example 2 - Array with each method

        cities = ["Sydney", "Melbourne", "Brisbane"]
        
        cities.each do |city| 
            puts "The city is #{city}"
        end

- As examplified, the **variable between the pipes** can be named ANYTHING. 

- BUT it is BEST PRACTICE to name it something related to the **variable** to be iterated on. 

- In this manner, example 2 (above) has a **better naming convention** than example 1 (above).

# Each method with Hash

## Example 1 - Hash with each method

        capital_cities = {:nsw => "Sydney", :vic => "Melbourne", :qld => "Brisbane"}
        
        capital_cities.each do |key, value|
            p key, value
        end

        => :nsw
        => "Sydney"
        => :vic
        => "Melbourne"
        => :qld
        => "Brisbane"

## Example 2 - Hash with each method

        capital_cities = {:nsw => "Sydney", :vic => "Melbourne", :qld => "Brisbane"}
        
        capital_cities.each do |state, city|
            puts "the capital city of #{state} is #{city}
        end

        => the capital city of nsw is Sydney
        => the capital city of vic is Melbourne
        => the capital city of qld is Brisbane
       


# each_with_index 

- **each_with_index** is similar to the **each** method, however it takes TWO arguments from an **array** and three arguments from a **hash**:
        
  - ARRAY with each_with_index - The **value** of an array and its **index** (see example below). 

    


        numbers = ["one","two","three","four"]
        
        numbers.each_with_index do |item, index|
                p item
                p index
        end

  - HASH with each_with_index - The **key**, **value** and **index** for a hash (see example below). 

        capital_cities = { :nsw => "Sydney", :vic "Melbourne", :qld => "Brisbane"}
        
        capital_cities_each_with_index do | (key, value), index |
                p key, value, index
        end

# array.each_with_index 

**Example 1**: 

        cities = ["Sydney", "Melbourne", "Brisbane"]

        cities.each_with_index {|city,index| puts "The city is #{city} at index position #{index}"}

**Returns**:

        => The city is Sydney at index position 0
        => The city is Melbourne at index position 1
        => The city is Brisbane at index position 2



# hash.each_with_index 

- When we are passing the three arguments **key**, **value** and **index**, it is important to place the **key**, **value** inside () *referred to as parentheses*.

                | (key, value), index |


**Example 1** -hash.each_with_index

        capital_cities = { :nsw => "Sydney", :vic => "Melbourne", :qld => "Brisbane"}

        capital_cities.each_with_index do |(state, city), index| 

        puts "The capital city of #{state} is #{city}"
        puts "Index position is #{index}"

        end


Returns:

        => The capital city of nsw is Sydney
        => Index position is 0
        => The capital city of vic is Melbourne
        => Index position is 1
        => The capital city of qld is Brisbane
        => Index position is 2

- Most of the time, this method to find the index is NOT used with a **hash**.

- Instead, we use this method with an **array**.

# Map 

- Map is an **iterator method** SIMILAR to **each** with ONE KEY DIFFERENCE.

- It ALSO iterates through EVERY element within an **array** or a **hash**.

- Map creates a BRAND NEW ARRAY from **values** returned by the **block**.

Example 1:


        â€‹numbers = ["one","two","three","four"]

        numbers_uppercased = numbers.map do |item|
                item.upcase
        end

        p numbers
        p numbers_uppercased

Result:

        => ["one", "two", "three", "four"]
        => ["ONE", "TWO", "THREE", "FOUR"]


Example 2:

        names = ["bob","charlie", "Amy"]
        
        capitalized_names = names.map {|name| name.upcase}

        p names
        p capitalized_names

Result:
        
        => ["bob", "charlie", "Amy"]
        => ["BOB", "CHARLIE", "AMY"]

# Key Difference between Map and Each

- The KEY difference is we will use MAP when want want to **generate a NEW array** from the original array. 

- However, if we are just interested in **iterating through an element** and performing a **certain action** and NOT interested in generating a new array, we can use the EACH method.


# Filter/Select

- **select** return a NEW array with the TRUTHY results. 


Example 1: Normal syntax


        [1,2,3,4,5].select do |num|
            num.even?
        end

Example 2: Shorthand syntax

        
        [1,2,3,4,5].select {|num| num.even?}

Result (for both examples)

        => [2,4]

- Whenever we are using a **filter** or a **select** method, we NEED a **truth or false condition**.

        num.even?

- This will return the even numbers in the array.

        [2,4]

OR WE CAN USE ANOTHER TRUTHY CONDITION

        num.odd?

- This will return the odd numbers in the array.

        [1,3,5]
