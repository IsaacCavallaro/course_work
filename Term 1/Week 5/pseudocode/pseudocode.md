# What is Pseudocode? 

- A human language description of an algorithm.

- An algorithm is basically a sequence of steps that’s required to solve some sort of problem.

- Pseudocode is NOT specific to any programming language. 

- It is a human language used to describe an algorithm. NOT specific to any syntax or grammar related to a  programming language. 

- Pseudocode focus on the logic of solving the problem rather than how it will be worked out in a particular language.

- Well written pseudocode should be easy to translate into ANY programming language.  

# What is pseudocode used for?

- Pseudocode is used  to design. 

- We write pseudocode  to design an algorithm. 

- In other words, we use pseudocode to design a solution to a problem. 

- For this reason, pseudocode is usually written before any actually computer code it written. 

- You may even think of it as kind of a simple prototype of the final product. 

# Who is pseudocode for?

-  First we are writing it for ourselves. 

- Pseudocode code is often our first tool when we are solving a problem.

- Pseudocode  is a fundamental part of your programming process. 

- We also write pseudocode for others. 

- Pseudocode is often shared with a team or required by a client before any actual coding work can begin.

- In this case, you may choose to format you pseudocode more formally that if you were just writing it for yourself. 

- Because of the range of people who may read your pseudocode code (non-technical people to very technical people and everyone in between), keeping your language simple is a really important aspect of writing pseudocode.

## STEP 1: Problem Definition

- Step one in writing pseudocode is to read the problem definition. SO if we are going to write pseudocode, WHAT ARE WE WRITING IT FOR?

- Example: 

    - How many weeks it will take to save the money for a new computer after you have paid your living expenses? 

## STEP 2: Define the inputs

-  In other words, what are the values that are required by the program in order to solve the problem? We give each input a unique a meaningful name. 

So the inputs for the example would be 

- WeeklyWages
- WeeklyLivingExpenses
- PriceOfNewComputer

## STEP 3: Define the Outputs 

- These values are the result of processing of inputs. We give each output a unique and manful name. 

The outputs for this problem are

- NetWages
- NumberOfWeeksRequired

These are the things we expect to get as OUTPUT from our program.

## STEP 4: Define the process (aka write the pseudocode) 

- These are the things that will need to happen at EACH STEP of the algorithm in order to arrive at the solution to the problem. 

- This list of steps is called pseudocode. 

- All algorithms have a sequence. The importance of that sequence becomes clear if you were to imagine swapping around some of those steps. 

**Example:**

1. Get WeeklyWages

2. Get WeeklyLivingExpenses
3. Get PriceOfNewComputer
4. NetWages = WeeklyWages - WeeklyLivingExpenses
5. NumberOfWeeksRequired = PriceOfNewComputer/NetWages
6. Display the result to the user

## The order of these steps in REALLY IMPORTANT.

- Imagine for example if you tried to do number 5 before you did step number 2? How are you going to do price of the new computer divided by net wrages if you don’t yet know what the price of the new computer or net wages are?

- So the algorithm is a serious of steps the need to be executed in a  particular order and pseudocode is a way that we can write our steps in our process down without having to use any particularly programming language syntax.
