# Definition

- HTTP is the protocol that computers use to communicate to each other over the internet. 

- A protocol is a set of rules for how messages are formatted, transmitted and responded too. 

- Just think about how many interactions happen on the internet everyday. Every time a user wants something from a website, it has to send an HTTP request. 

- If the HTTP request is correct and the user is allowed to do that request, the website will send a response back. 

- Importantly, not all types of HTTP requests are the same. 

- Depending on the type of request, HTTP uses different verbs or methods. 


# HTTP Methods

- HTTP uses different verse or methods for different actions we want the server to do. 

- The stand HTTP verbs are:

	- GET -> Retrieve a resource (Read)
	- POST -> Create a resource 
	- PUT/PATCH -> Update a resource 
	- DELETE -> Delete a resource 


## GET

- The GET verb/method is the most common.

- Every time we receive a webpage or a website and read its content, it is because a GET request has been sent. 


## POST

-  We send a POST request when want to add new information to a server. 

- For example: 

    - When a user fills out a form and click submit.
    - When a user posts to social media.

- Both of the examples use POST requests. 


## PUT/PATCH

- PUT and PATCH are both used to update information. 

- The most common use of these two methods is when we want to edit information that tis already on the sever:

	- Updating data from our personal account.

	- Edit a post from out blog. 

- Both of the examples use a PUT or a PATH method. 


## DELETE


- The DELETE method is used when we want to remove something from the server. 



# CRUD

- Crud stands for:

	- Create
	- Read
	- Update
	- Delete

- These are the four most common operations we do on a website.
