# Why are CS fundamentals important?

- Computer Science (CS) fundamentals skills are critical for any kind of programming. In this course, we focus on skills in the area of:

	- Logic
	- Data structures
	- Algorithms 

- Every programmer must be at least familiar with these topics to be effective and be able to advance their understanding of programming. 

- At the root of what we are doing as programmers is solving problems. 

- Even more accurately, programmers are teaching a computer how to solve problems and this requires some common skills. 


# What will be covered?


- Number systems (bases)

- Boolean logic

- Sets

- Big O notation (algorithm complexity) 

- Matrices 

- Graphs 

- Functions & relations 

# Number Systems 

- We are all familiar with the decimal number system or base 10 

- It’s important to understand binary and hexadecimal number systems because those are two number systems that are used throughout programming and Computer Science. 

- All the data in a computer is represented as 1’s and 0’s (true or false); the binary number system. 

- We use the binary number system to represent everything that’s ever been done by a computer or electronics.

# Boolean Logic

- Constructs like if statements and loops which use boolean logic.

- Getting a deeper understanding of boolean logic and the types of boolean operators is important for developers. 

# Sets

- Sets is an important data structure.

- Sets are used to represent a collection of unique items, and it is used in many types of programming problems. 

- It is so common that there are lots of procedures and processes that are used to operate on Sets and that represent Sets. 

# Big O Notation

- Big O notation is what we use to describe the complexity and performance of algorithms that we write as programmers. 

- This is one of those topics that can come up in technical interviews. 

- Confidence will follow after understanding Big O Notation. 

# Matrices 

- Matrices are another data structure that we used a lot as developers.

- Matrices are basically two dimensional arrays. 

# Graphs

- Graphs are another data structure that are used to express data as nodes with edges connecting them.

- Those edges represent the relationships between the pieces of data.

- Graphs are used for path optimisation and to represent maps.

- Graphs are a really powerful data structure and are very interesting to understand how we represent data in graphs and how to manipulate data in graphs. 

# Functions & Relations

- This one might look a bit scary on the surface because it includes equations other mathematical operations.


# Thoughts on Discrete Maths

- Mathematics is fascinating and mathematics is at the core of these computer science fundamentals.

- You can think of it as finding ways, tools and skills to understand the underlying language that’s beneath all programming languages.

- Mathematics is the heart of what makes a computer work. 


# Secrets to Success

1. Watch the videos MORE THAN ONCE and with pauses if you need.
2. Do the practice, do all of the learning activities for each topic.
3. Ask for help - if you have any trouble doing the practice, or understanding why you are not getting the right answers, ask for help.
