## Data vs Information

- We first need to distinguish the difference between data and information. 

## Data 

- Raw, unfiltered, unrelated material that can be in any format (text, images, numbers etc).

- Data is meaningless.

## Information

- Consists of collected and related data that has been analysed.

- We filter information and we process information. 

- Delivers meaning.


# What is a Database?


- A database is just an organised and structured collection of related data. 

- What we do with a database is we store related pieces of data together. 

- This allows data to be used as information by collecting and storing the data in a meaningful way, enabling use of the data. 

- When we talk about databases, weâ€™re typically talking about some physical structure that we can access with a Database Management System (DBMS). 

    - There are two ways we can structure this database to create information and one of them is called a Relational Database.


# Relational Databases

- Relational databases organise data in tables with rows and columns.

-  The table represents a relation because it defines the ways that the data relates as information. 

- The columns indicate attributes (also known as domains or types) for the data. 

- The rows (also called tuples) represent individual records in the table.
