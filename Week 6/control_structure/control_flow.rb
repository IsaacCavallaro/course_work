# Control Structures from Ed

######## PART ONE ##########
#(Standard if else control structure/control flow)

# raining = true 

# if raining 
#     puts "carry umbrella"
# else 
#     puts "don't carry an umbrella"
# end

######## PART TWO ##########
#(Alternate shorthand syntax to if else is ternary operators)

raining = true

puts raining ? "carry umbrella" : "don't carry an umbrella" #same as part one but in one line of code!
